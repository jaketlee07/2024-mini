# Exercise 01

### Description:
Circuit connected as described in the problem. To find minimum brightness, we covered the photocell from all angles. To find maximum brightness we flashed a flashlight directly onto the photocell. 

### Questions:
We discovered the dark reading to be around 430, therefore we set the variable to 400 to account for lower brightness.
The bright reading was between 47200 and 47500, so we set max_bright to be 50000, since light can be brighter than a phone flashlight.

# Exercise 02

### Description:
We connected the speaker as described in the problem. After playing around with the playtone function, we discovered we can play a song by storing the frequency orders in an array, and looping through each frequency in order. For the duration, we have a separate array that stores the number of beats each note is played for. In the loop each value in the duration array was adjusted to account for tempo. 

### Questions:
We decided to play the Nokia theme. Since I already knew the notes of the song, I matched each note to its respective frequency and stored it in the frequency array.

The duration of the notes were stored in another array where 8 is a quarter note, 16 is a half note, and 32 is a whole note.

In the loop, each note and duration was played in order to create the Nokia theme.
